# Range Optimization Report
## 1. Overview of Optimum Values
•	Optimal Torque: 150 Nm and 260.33 Nm are identified as efficient torque levels.
•	Optimal Speed: 10 km/h is the speed with the lowest energy consumption.
•	Estimated Range: At both torque levels, the highest range (54.22 km) is achieved at 10 km/h.
These findings highlight that the vehicle achieves maximum energy efficiency at low speeds (e.g., 10 km/h) and low torque levels.

## 4. Recommendations
1. Efficient Usage at Low Speeds and Torque
•	10 km/h and 150 Nm: This combination offers the lowest energy consumption and the maximum range, making it ideal for urban driving.
•	City Driving: Maintaining low speeds in urban conditions can help minimize range loss.

2. Energy Optimization at Medium Speeds (20-30 km/h)
•	Aerodynamic Enhancements: Reducing air resistance can improve efficiency, especially at higher speeds.
•	Transmission Optimization: More efficient torque and motor control strategies could reduce energy consumption at 30 km/h.
3. Strategies for High Speeds (>50 km/h)
•	Regenerative Braking: Recovering energy during braking can increase range.
•	Speed Management Systems: Implementing speed limiters can optimize range for necessary high-speed driving scenarios.
4. Torque Optimization
•	260.33 Nm Torque: Suitable for high-demand situations like hill climbing or acceleration. However, lower torque levels can be more efficient on flat roads.
•	High Torque and Low Speed: This combination can be beneficial under challenging conditions such as steep slopes.
5. Driving Style Optimization
•	Avoid Sudden Accelerations and Braking: Smooth acceleration and maintaining a steady speed can improve energy management and range.
